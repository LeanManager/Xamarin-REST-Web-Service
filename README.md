REST Web Service in Xamarin.Forms application

Xamarin.Forms application consuming an existing REST service which manages a library of books. 

Ability to authenticate with the service, retrieve existing books, add new books, update books and delete books from your bookshelf.

1) Used JSON.Net to serialize/deserialize objects
2) Used HttpClient instances and methods to communicate with the web service
3) Used HTTP headers and HTTP handlers
4) Worked with iOS App Transport Security (ATS)
5) Used an optimized, platform-specific web client implementation to access the REST service
